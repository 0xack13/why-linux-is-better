Technical deficiencies
----------------------

-- Maximum path lengths. Not a flaw in NTFS, but in the Windows OS itself. 260 characters, including filename.

-- Does this cause real problems in real software? Yes.

-- No built-in support for any filesystems but NTFS and FAT32/FAT16.

-- Ease of bug reporting and logging.
On Windows, you can (sometimes) use Ctrl-C when an error window pops up to copy the error message.
On Linux, you can attach gdb to a running process, start a logfile that catches all output to stderr, and run a backtrace when the program fails.

-- NTFS on Windows cannot be case sensitive because Windows is not case sensitive, though it is case-preserving

-- Windows applications lock files they use by default, so misbehaving applications can be a serious unintentional nuisance.

Configuration deficiencies
--------------------------

-- Configuration files are not centralized in the user's home directory.
Most of the things that users care about -- not losing configuration between installs -- are scattered around in various directories.
On Linux, system level configuration is stored in /etc/ and user level configuration is stored in dotfiles (hidden folders) in the home directory.

-- Package manager with signed binaries and easy backup/reinstall.

-- Fixing configuration problems with commands instead of GUIs.
GUIs are good for some applications. They are clumsy and error-prone for fixing configuration problems.
Many Linux config problems can be fixed by a simple script that can be pasted into a terminal.
Windows requires navigating deeply nested GUIs and ticking various checkboxes.
